# csv-to-json-converter

A converter from CSV to JSON without using any CSV parsing libraries. Was a fun challenge!

### Challenge Considerations:

* Needs to consider that delimiter could be either a comma or a vertical pipe
* Needs to keep the contents in double quotation marks untouched

### Languages used:
Python

### Python libraries used:
* Re
* json
